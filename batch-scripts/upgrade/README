To upgrade the database simply run:

	cd mediacore_install/
	paster setup-app deployment.ini

This will run all the pending migrations necessary to bring your
database up-to-date.

Please note that we only support upgrades from MediaCore 0.9.0
(or any later version). If you happen to run MediaCore 0.7 or 0.8
please upgrade to 0.9.0 first.
